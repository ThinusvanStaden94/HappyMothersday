      <h2>About My Mom</h2>
      <img src="Mom.jpg" alt="Picture of Mom">
      <p>My mom is the best mom in the world. There are so many people who say they have the best mom in the world, but i really do have the best mom. My mom has always been there for me. Through good times and bad, I knew I could always depend on my mom's support.She always loves unconditionally, and although I have done so many things to make her angry and disappointed in me, that will never go away. through all the fights and all the trouble and disappointments, all the sickness, we still continue to love each other. A mother's love is special, it is one of the best forms of love. My mom is a fantastic teacher, not only to her students, but to her children as well. my mom is resilient, she fights for what she believes in, and she never backs down from any challenges. I wish that I could be half as strong my mom. I look up to her so much. </p>
      <p>Mom, thank you for being my mom. Thank you for everything that you do for me. Thank you for the person that you are. Thank you for being an example and inspiration. Thank you for always being there.</p>
      <p>I love you so much mom.</p>
      <p>Your Son</p>
